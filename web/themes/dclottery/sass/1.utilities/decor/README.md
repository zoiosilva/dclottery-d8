# DECOR styles

Decor styles are sets of styling that are purely decorative and repeated frequently in the design. Examples:  special border treatments, special flourishes on headings, common drop shadows or gradient effects, etc.

The main thing that sets a decor "component" apart from other components is that it has no semantic meaning, and whatever visual flair it adds is likely to be ignored by screenreaders, for example.

And since these are decorative only and not semantic, feel free to name them non-semantically. You are describing a collection of properties that replicates a specific visual accent, after all.

Here are some examples of names of common decor patterns we have used in other projects:

`.decor--animated-arrow`, `.decor--double-border`, `.decor--hover-pop`, `.decor--fade-in-on-scroll`, `.decor--floral-title`, `.decor--heading-dash`, etc.
